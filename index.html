            <dt><strong>From today's featured article</strong></dt>
            <dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transandinomys_talamancae">Transandinomys talamancae</a> is a
                widespread and common rodent in the genus Transandinomys that occurs from Costa Rica to southwestern
                Ecuador and northern Venezuela. Its habitat is lowland forests up to an altitude of 1,500 m (5,000 ft).
                It is a medium-sized rice rat with soft fur, reddish to brownish on the overparts and whitish on the
                underparts. The ears and feet are long, and the tail is dark brown above and lighter below. The whiskers
                are very long. The species was first described in 1891 by Joel Asaph Allen. It was considered to be
                conspecific with what is now Hylaeamys megacephalus from the 1960s until the 1980s and was then placed
                in the genus Oryzomys until 2006, when it was moved to its current genus. This is a terrestrial
                nocturnal rat that eats plants and insects. It breeds throughout the year, but few individuals survive
                for more than a year. After a gestation of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual
                maturity within two months.</dd>
